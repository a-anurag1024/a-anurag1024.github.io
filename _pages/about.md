👋 Hi, I’m **Aditya** - an **AI Engineer** passionate about building systems that think, speak, and act intelligently, guided by solid business logic and driven by the principle of **maximizing value-to-cost ratio**.  
I explore how **agentic architectures** can redefine the way we learn, create, and communicate - from **interactive education** to **digital marketing automation**.

## 🔭 Currently Exploring  

- **Designing Agentic Systems** - Building autonomous, context-aware agents for real-world applications.  
- **AI Systems Design** - From neural network architecture & training pipeline design to scalable, production-ready deployment systems.  
- **Evaluating Agentic Behaviors** - Studying frameworks and metrics to assess adaptability, goal-alignment, and reasoning depth in multi-agent systems.
- **Human-AI Collaboration** - Crafting tools that enhance creativity and learning through adaptive feedback and interactivity.
